`utdnsd`, a DNS forwarder serving requests from UDP clients by delegating them to upstream DNS servers with TCP.  The idea is from `ttdnsd` of Tor Project.

OpenWrt package definition files can be found at [waller repository](https://github.com/yousong/waller); detailed instructions of how to import them should be included there.

## Build

[`libubox`](http://git.openwrt.org/?p=project/libubox.git;a=summary) from OpenWrt project is required.  On Mac OS X with MacPorts installed, you can get `libubox` installed by using portfiles from [macports-openwrt repository](https://github.com/yousong/macports-openwrt).

To build it locally (of course, CMake is required here).

	cmake . && make

To configure the build (mainly the `DEBUG` option).

	ccmake .

## Run.

When run without arguments, help text will be printed to stderr.

    Usage: utdnsd [ -qrh ] -l <host[:port]> [ -s <host[:port]> ... ] [ -t <seconds> ]
      -l <host[:port]>  Address and port to listen to.
      -s <host[:port]>  Upstream DNS server we ask for service through TCP transport.
      -t <seconds>      Maximum delay for reconnect attempts (defaults to 5s).
      -T <seconds>      Maximum delay before the link was considered shoddy (defaults to 5s).
      -r                Reconnect on tcp connection hup.
      -q                Be quiet.
      -h                This output.

Currently, at most 8 `-s <host:[port]>` can be specified on the command line.  Same upstream server can be specified multiple times with the `-s` option.

	=================== statistics ends

As you can see from the above output, sending `SIGUSR1` to `utdnsd` will cause it to print some statistics.

## Quirks

Below are some different strategies or situations I came across while doing testing against a varieties of public DNS servers.

- Only 1 query per TCP connection.  Disconnect at the end of that transaction.

		114.114.114.114

- Only 1 connection per IP (this is a guess), other connections may hang or delay with `ACK`, `ACK`, ...

## Tips

If you have got a long list of usable DNS servers and in a decidophobia as to which ones to use.  Then some randomness can help.

	server_list='hk.txt.1'

	total="$(wc -l "$server_list" | awk '{ print $1; }')"
	[ "$total" -gt "8" ] && {
		total="$(( $total - 8 ))"
		pos="$(( $RANDOM % $total ))"
		servers="$(sed -n "$pos,$(($pos+7))p" "$server_list")"
	} || {
		servers="$(cat "$server_list")"
	}

	sopts=""
	for s in $servers; do
			sopts="$sopts -s $s"
	done
	./utdnsd -l 127.0.0.1:8053 $sopts

Test it with `dig`, `nslookup`.

	# use +short for returning only IP adresses.
	dig +noshort -p 8053 @127.0.0.1 www.openvpn.net
	nslookup www.openvpn.net 127.0.0.1 -port=8053
	nslookup www.openvpn.net 127.0.0.1:8053

## TODO

- A list of domain names from browser history for testing purposes.
